# MVVM-Dagger-Room
News App is a simple news app 🗞️ which uses NewsAPI to fetch top news headlines from the API. 
The codebase focuses 👓 on following key things:

Code structuring, style and comments
Dependency injection 🗡
Offline first ✈️
Kotlin + Coroutines
And tests 🛠

The app uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.
